## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Off-black (#333333) for primary text and elements, providing a professional feel. Based on the existing branding's black, we opt for a less harsh tone, in line with contemporary design trends.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), provides a neutral backdrop for content.
- Accent color: Dark gray (#666666), to maintain the grayscale scheme and highlight important elements or interactive components. Given the overall dark color scheme, we want this color to contrast, while remaining desaturated.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif. A neutral and modern font, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Line-based icons: Use simple, line-based icons with black or gray outlines to maintain the minimalist design. The Icon should be from simple line based libraries.
- Whitespace and separators: Focus on whitespace and subtle separators instead of heavy borders for a clean look.
- Subtle animations: Implement light fade-in animations for loading and confirmation states to enhance UX without being distracting.
